# 🚀 SpaceX Launch Success Prediction Overview

This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal was to analyze and predict SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches, focusing on the success rate of first-stage landings.

As part of my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, I used Python, machine learning, and data visualization to explore patterns in launch outcomes and build predictive models.

# 🎯 Objectives

Perform data collection, wrangling, and cleaning from SpaceX APIs and Wikipedia.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization tools.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict landing outcomes.

# 📊 Data Sources

SpaceX API (launch data)

Wikipedia (historical mission details)

Processed into structured CSV files for analysis.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Folium, Plotly

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Identified launch trends over time.

Visualized launch sites on interactive maps (Folium).

Analyzed the impact of payload mass, booster version, and orbit type on landing success.

# 🤖 Machine Learning

Models tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Best-performing model: Logistic Regression at 83% accuracy (see Lab 8 - Machine Learning).

# 📈 Results

Found that payload mass and orbit type are strong predictors of landing success.

Produced an interactive dashboard to visualize launch outcomes.
